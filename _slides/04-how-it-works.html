<h1>How it works &#8211; Just press F11!</h1>
<p>The Slide Show (S9) Ruby gem turns your slides in plain text into a web page
that&#8217;s an all-in-one-page handout and a live slide show all at once.</p>
<pre class='code'>
$ slideshow build tutorial.txt

=&gt; Preparing slideshow 'tutorial.html'...
=&gt; Done.
</pre>
<p>Turn your web page into a slide show and your browser into full screen projection
with a single push button (F11).  Hit the space bar or the right arrow, down arrow
or page down key to flip through your slides.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
